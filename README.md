<h1>Resolving Tickets in osTicket</h1>
In this lab I go through an example of the typical lifecycle of a ticket from start to end with the ticketing system OsTicket.<br />

<h2>Lifecycle Stages</h2>

From the support ticket portal, users can put in their information and submit tickets and detail their IT issues. Here, I have created a ticket as the user Karen about an issue with the online banking system.

Agents will receive the ticket requests in their agent panel as they are sent, which they can then look at and resolve themselves or reassign to the appropriate agent or team if necessary. They’ll also be able to change other properties of the ticket such as it’s priority, SLA, help topic, etc. Here, after logging in as the agent John, I review the ticket and reassign it to online banking team where Jane, who is part of that team, can handle the ticket. I also change the SLA to Sev-A as it appears to be a serious issue as well as change the help topic to be more precise.

Now, logging in as Jane of the online banking team, I receive the ticket and can handle and resolve it. When resolving tickets, it is important to have good documentation so that it can be referenced back in the future to see what the problem was and how it was resolved. This is beneficial not just for documentation purposes but also to reference if a similar issue arises in the future.
